## Problem Statement

The TechnoEdge Financial Details dataset contains information related to the sales of different products in various countries and segments. It includes data on the number of units sold, manufacturing and sale price, gross sales, discounts, COGS, profit, and date of sale. The dataset is organized by month and discount band.
We need to Explore TechnoEdge Financial Performance with Interactive Data Analysis on Sales, Profit, and Discounts Across Product Segments and Countries.

## Objectives

1) Identify the top-selling product by country and segment and determine how much profit is generated by each product.

2) Analyze the impact of discount bands on the units sold and gross sales by product, country, and segment.

3) Identify which months of the year generate the most sales and profit for TechnoEdge across all countries and segments.

4) Determine the relationship between manufacturing price and gross sales, and identify any products or segments where there may be pricing issues.

5) Analyze the COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) for each product and identify any that may have excessive costs, reducing overall profit.

6) Evaluate the performance of each country and segment in terms of sales and profit, and identify any areas for improvement.

7) Analyze the daily sales trends and identify which days of the week have the highest sales volume.




### Data Cleaning

1) To combine multiple tables in Power Query of Power BI, use the "Append Queries" feature and select the relevant tables, ensuring they have the same structure. Renaming tables and organizing them in folders can help with navigation.

2) Used the "Change Type" option in Power Query to alter data types for each column

3) Utilized the "Replace Values" option in Power Query to edit the Country Name column to have each word capitalized.

4) Used the "Remove Duplicates" option in Power Query to remove duplicate values from the dataset.

5) Created a conditional column using the "Add Conditional Column" option in Power Query and set the condition to display the sales ratio based on the sales column.

6) Filtered the dataset to remove rows with null values.

7) Analyzed the daily sales trends and identify which days of the week have the highest sales volume.
